## Prerequisites

## Use

In the vehicle sales assistant (VSA), you can add new customers whose information then gets saved in the master data. This function is particularly useful, for example, when customers directly walk into your location with a requirement.

## Procedure

To create a new customer, proceed as follows:

1.  On the VSA home screen, choose *Create* > *Customer*. Alternatively, from the *Index* screen, choose *DBM Vehicle Sales Assistant* > *Overview* > *Vehicle Sales Assistant* > *Create* > *Customer*.

    The *Create Customer* screen opens.

    > Note:
    > You can also open this screen when you are creating a deal; on the *Select Customer* screen, choose *Create Customer*.
    > 
    > 

2.  Enter the appropriate customer information.

3.  Choose *Save* to save the information.


To modify existing customer information, proceed as follows:

1.  You can search for existing customers using the *Quick Access* or *Search* functions on the VSA home screen. Alternatively, if creating a deal, choose the *Change Customer* icon on the *Select Customer* screen.

2.  On the *Business Partner Cockpit* screen that opens, modify the appropriate customer data and save your changes.
